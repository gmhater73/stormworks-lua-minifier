uses a modified version of [luamin](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/luamin) that was itself modified by [crazyfluffypony](https://lua.flaffipony.rocks/) as well as [luaparse](https://github.com/fstirlitz/luaparse) then conducts shenanigans to minify it further in a way that hopefully doesn't break your code
